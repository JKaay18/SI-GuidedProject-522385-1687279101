The "Suicide in India Visualizations Project" aims to analyze and present visualizations of suicide data in India. 
The project will gather data from various sources and create interactive charts, graphs, maps, and infographics to illustrate suicide rates, demographic distributions, regional disparities, socioeconomic factors, and common causes of suicide in India. 
The visualizations will provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue and help inform policymakers, researchers, and the general public about suicide trends and potential correlations with social, economic, or cultural factors.
